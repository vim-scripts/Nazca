This is Nazca and it is based in ir_black and Sunburst for Textmate.

I've tweaked this colorscheme for Web Development, so it works nice with Javascript, X(HTML)5, Ruby and CSS
Any other filetypes should look nice as well.

For uniform appearance, I've tested it in graphical Vim full color (gvim and macvim) and also 256 color iTerm2.app in Mac OSX and the gnome terminal in Linux.
